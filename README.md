- Everything is kinda ugly (css rework)

- Add stuff like logging out, register button on the login page

- save massages to database

- USER SANITATION!!!!! (no more xss, i think i prevented sql injection with mysql.escape())

- restructure of backend

- optimizing in general

- maybe  require email for registration to allow nickname changing


For the really bord times:

- mobile port
