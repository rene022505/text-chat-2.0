- load messages when enter chat (x at a time find way to load more when needed etc)

- USER SANITATION!!!!! (no more xss, i think i prevented sql injection with mysql.escape())

- restructure of backend

- optimizing in general

- maybe  require email for registration to allow nickname changing

- encryption for messages and usernames

- add message limit 1000 chars limitation client and server side

- dont access chat if not signed in

- dont send pfp with every message, cache it somehow idk

- change message order server side

- line 40 in registerJS doesnt work for some reason (nothing happens /shrug)
